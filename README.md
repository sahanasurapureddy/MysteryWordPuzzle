Creating a Mystery puzzle game was a fun project that took us on a wild ride of design and development challenges, successes, and lessons learned. Our project's goal was to provide users with an engaging and interactive experience, allowing them to explore various themes and solve word puzzles.

## Reflection on Design & Development:
We used the Scrum technique as the foundation for our project management. Our cross-disciplinary team thoughtfully got together to focus on the challenges presented by the project efficiently. We divided our work into brief sprints that lasted one to two weeks, each with a carefully selected list of urgent tasks. Our weekly stand-up meetings were a crucial component of our schedule since they ensured everyone on the team was on the same page and could solve problems promptly. We held review meetings to consider what went well and areas for improvement after each sprint and reviews to highlight our successes and solicit feedback. We saw increased cooperation and productivity when we used Scrum, which made it possible for us to produce outcomes quickly. Despite the difficulties, our Scrum implementation taught us invaluable lessons that we can use in future projects.

The gameplay experience, where users may click on a link to visit a Mystery puzzle with a theme, was at the heart of the project. The mechanics of the game allowed users to engage with the problem by selecting letters connected with the words on the list. The main gameplay ran successfully, with participants receiving quick feedback as solved words were highlighted and struck out on the list. This feedback mechanism contributed greatly to a sense of progress and accomplishment. The difficulty lay in controlling overlapping letters on the board, which occasionally generated confusion and necessitated careful design and additional coding for touch events on mobile devices.

### Features & Challenges üíæ
* One unique aspect of the game was the "Mystery Words" feature, which allowed players to uncover words that were still unsolved. This feature was created to help players who got stuck so that the game would stay interesting. It worked well, providing assistance without overly simplifying the game. Finding a balance between helping players and maintaining the game's difficulty was difficult, but it was necessary to make sure that doing so improved the experience rather than made it less enjoyable. Implementing puzzle that can incorporate multiple themes and generate word puzzle based on related words to that particular theme was a challenging task for us. But we were able to implement it and have mouse animations succesfully work as well. We had thought of having a animation popup generate, when the user solves the whole puzzle but we were able to implement only a alert pop up on completing the challenge. The animation popup was hindering our functionality due to which we didn't implement on our code which we are hoping to  incorporate in our future enhancement on this puzzle board. 

### Lessons Learnt:
To summarize, developing the word search game with theme-changing capabilities was a challenging and rewarding journey. The ability to respond to user feedback, balance gameplay elements, and resolve technical issues was critical to the project's success. It emphasized the importance of user-centered design, the art of balancing challenge and assistance in game design, and the importance of optimizing for mobile devices in order to reach a wider audience. Finally, this project taught valuable lessons about iteration and the commitment to providing a fun and engaging experience for players.

Reference for our game was taken from the Github according to our game's necessity. GitID for Author of the reference game is XXXXXX. We borrowed this specific code as it matches with the requirements and functionality(generating puzzles, checking word validity and managing game logic etc) which we decided to include in our game.
