## Welcome to Mystery Word Puzzle -  Explore the Word Puzzle and identify the Mystery words based on different themes

### Overview üìñ
Creating a Mystery puzzle game was a fun project that took us on a wild ride of design and development challenges, successes, and lessons learned. Our project's goal was to provide users with an engaging and interactive experience, allowing them to explore various themes and solve word puzzles.
The Mystery puzzle is hosted on a live server. You can play the game by visiting the following URL: [Mystery Word Puzzle](https://sahanasurapureddy.github.io/MysteryWordPuzzle/)

## Reflection on Design & Development:
The design and development process of creating the Mystery Word Puzzle game was an exhilarating journey filled with challenges, successes, and invaluable lessons. It was a project that allowed our team to explore the boundaries of creativity while adhering to a systematic approach.

### Scrum as the Project Foundation: 
The adoption of the Scrum project management framework was critical to our success. It brought order to our project's complexity and transformed our multidisciplinary team into an efficient and collaborative unit. Scrum encouraged us to divide our work into manageable sprints of one to two weeks. This approach allowed us to focus on the most pressing tasks while iterating continuously, which was critical in a project where user engagement was critical.

### Review and Continuous Improvement:
We held review meetings after each sprint. These meetings provided an opportunity to consider what went well and where improvements could be made. We didn't just look at project progress; we looked at the process as a whole, always looking for ways to improve efficiency and effectiveness. We refined our approach due to a culture of continuous improvement.

### Improved Collaboration and Productivity: 
The implementation of Scrum resulted in a transformation of our team. It promoted increased cooperation and productivity, two critical success factors. We saw firsthand how Scrum's principles fostered an environment in which team members collaborated effectively, played to their strengths, and were motivated to excel. As a result, the project moved quickly and produced precise results.

### Development and Testing:
The Mystery Word Puzzle project introduced us to a world of creative possibilities in the technical realm. Our development efforts were focused on the gameplay experience. Users could access a Mystery puzzle with a specific theme by clicking on a link, and the game mechanics allowed them to select letters associated with the words on the list. This core gameplay feature was a significant technical achievement, as it provided users with immediate feedback as they solved words, which were highlighted and marked as completed on the list. This feedback mechanism's technical development significantly contributed to a sense of progress and achievement, increasing player engagement and satisfaction.

The testing phase of our project was critical. To ensure a seamless and enjoyable user experience, rigorous testing procedures were implemented to identify and correct any issues. Our team concentrated on user-centered design, attempting to strike a balance between challenge and assistance in game design.

### Features & Challenges üíæ
* One unique aspect of the game was the "Mystery Words" feature, which allowed players to uncover words that were still unsolved. This feature was created to help players who got stuck so that the game would stay interesting. It worked well, providing assistance without overly simplifying the game. Finding a balance between helping players and maintaining the game's difficulty was difficult, but it was necessary to make sure that doing so improved the experience rather than made it less enjoyable.
* Implementing puzzle that can incorporate multiple themes and generate word puzzle based on related words to that particular theme was a challenging task for us. But we were able to implement it and have mouse animations succesfully work as well. We had thought of having a animation popup generate, when the user solves the whole puzzle but we were able to implement only a alert pop up on completing the challenge. The animation popup was hindering our functionality due to which we didn't implement on our code which we are hoping to incorporate in our future enhancement on this puzzle board. 

### Lessons Learnt:
To summarize, developing the word search game with theme-changing capabilities was a challenging and rewarding journey. The ability to respond to user feedback, balance gameplay elements, and resolve technical issues was critical to the project's success. It emphasized the importance of user-centered design, the art of balancing challenge and assistance in game design, and the importance of optimizing for mobile devices in order to reach a wider audience. Finally, this project taught valuable lessons about iteration and the commitment to providing a fun and engaging experience for players.

3) Users can start clicking on the list of letters related to a word they found out by dragging the cursor over the letters.
4) If the user founds out correct word, solved word shows on the board with a background color and it gets striked on the list of words
5) Once the user solves the whole list of words, a notification pops up saying they have solved it.
6) If the user was unable to solve whole set of words in the list they can click on mystery words reveal button and it solves the puzzle for them.
7) If the user is not satisfied with the theme they can click on new theme button and it generates a new board with a different theme and list of words to search.
8) The letters might overlap on the board.
